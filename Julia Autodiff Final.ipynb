    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we build a simple prototype of source-to-source reverse-mode automatic differentiation. This is the same strategy used by `Zygote.jl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We opt to implement **reverse mode** automatic differentiation because it efficiently computes the gradient of functions with a (very) large number of inputs and a single output. This kind of problem shows up in all kinds of optimization, most notably machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also choose to do **source-to-source** transformation. This is substantially more complex to implement than dynamic systems, which build up a computation graph and then differentiate through it on every program run. The main benefit is that our gradient computation can be compiled ahead of time and optimized down by LLVM, instead of (expensively) re-built and (poorly) optimized every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also better than trace-based systems, which usually end up with a huge number of traced operations. Since there are so many operations, it's infeasible to analyze with optimization algorithms requiring `O(N^2)` time, and we're unable to optimize effectively anyway. (source: Zygote paper)"
